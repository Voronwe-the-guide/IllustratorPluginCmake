&lt;Not working> A test to port an Adobe Illustrator Plugin to Cmake


This is a try to port the MenuPlay from the Adobe Illustrator SDK Samples to CMake in Windows

The Cmake-file can be found in sampleCode/MenuPlay

The Illustrator API itself is not included, because I was unclear whether it is ok to do so. Add the folder "illustratorapi" to the main-folder
